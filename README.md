# Contact

### About

The main goal of this android app is to allow the user to save the contact of an individual without it having to show up in other apps like WhatsApp, Telegram etc.

### Why?

Well a lot of people have to save some contacts just for the sake of having them on their contacts list. However, apps like WhatsApp read your phone's contact list and now all of these contacts are a part of your WhatsApp feed and while WhatsApp provides some provisions to restrict who gets to view your photo, status etc, it is still a chore to manually exclude them.

This android app not only allows you to save the contacts that you might need but also make WhatsApp calls, text etc without the specific contact being included in your Stock PhoneBook and other app's lists.

### Security
Contact app is built on Android's ROOM database, which means that all the data is stored locally on user's device and no data leaves your device to our servers. This means, there are 0% chances of data leakage.

### Important Note
It is a common practise of OEMs to kill all non-major apps running in background. Therefore, you need to whitelist this app, so that it can function flawlessly.
