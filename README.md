# Contact

## About
Welcome to Contact App, the ultimate app for keeping your contacts separate from those sneaky apps like WhatsApp and Telegram that love to steal your contacts and add them to their list without your permission!

## Why?
Do you ever find yourself saving a contact just for the sake of having it on your list? If so, you're not alone. But with apps like WhatsApp reading your phone's contact list, those contacts become a part of your WhatsApp feed and while WhatsApp does provide some privacy settings, it can be a hassle to manually exclude contacts.

With Contact, you can save all the contacts you need without the risk of them showing up in other apps. And you can even make WhatsApp calls and send texts without the contact being included in your phone's default phonebook or other apps' lists.

## Security
Your privacy is our top priority! We use Android's ROOM database to store all your data locally on your device. That means your data never leaves your phone and your contacts are safe and sound.

## Important Note

It is a common practise of OEMs to kill all non-major apps running in background. Therefore, you need to whitelist this app, so that it can function flawlessly.
