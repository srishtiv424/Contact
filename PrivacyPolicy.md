## Privacy Policy

Vipul Mittal created the Contact app as a commercial service that is intended for use as is. This page is designed to inform users about our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information if you choose to use our service.

By using our service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. The personal information we collect is used for providing and improving our service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this privacy policy.

## Definitions

The terms used in this privacy policy have the same meanings as in our terms and conditions, which are accessible at Contact, unless otherwise defined in this privacy policy.

## Information Collection and Use

For a better user experience, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to contacts, call log, and accounts. We have used the ROOM database for database management, so all your data is saved on your phone and never leaves your device to our servers. No data is collected by us in any way.

The app does use third-party services from Google Play Services. We have employed third-party companies and individuals to facilitate the process of Google sign-in, to read and write contacts from your Google account, and to backup and restore the database file to Google Drive.

## Service Providers

We want to inform users of this service that these third parties have access to their personal information. The reason for this is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

## Permissions Required

The Contact app requires the following permissions to provide its services:

- Call: We need this permission to allow users to call a number directly from the app.
- Read Call Log: We need this permission to know the number of incoming and outgoing calls and then search the number in the offline database to show the popup of contact's name. We also need this permission to retrieve call logs from the user's device.
- Read Phone State: We need this permission to notify the user as soon as a call is made or received.
- Read Contacts: We need this permission to read contacts for the purpose of adding them to our app's database.
- Write Contacts: We need this permission to add or delete contacts from the user's phonebook directly from the app.
- System Alert Window: We need this permission to show a popup to the user when a call is made or received.
- Foreground Service: We need this permission to let our app run in the background all the time. Please note that this won't drain your battery, as the app isn't connected to servers.
- Internet: We need this permission to let a user sign in to their Google account. We also use this permission to upload and download the database file to and from Google Drive.
- Get Accounts: We need this permission to search for all the accounts logged into the user's phone.

## Security
We value your trust in giving your personal data to the app. We fully assure you that no data leaves your device to our servers. All data is stored on your phone, and you may choose to backup your database file to your Google Drive. This is the only possible way that your data leaves your phone and is sent to the cloud.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our privacy policy from time to time. Thus, we advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page.

## Links to Other Sites
We take the privacy of our users very seriously and are committed to protecting it in all aspects of our service. As part of our service, we may provide links to third-party websites, specifically WhatsApp, for the purpose of opening a user's WhatsApp page. Please note that these external sites are not operated by us, and we have no control over their content, privacy policies, or practices.

Therefore, we strongly advise our users to review the privacy policies of these third-party websites before engaging with them. We assume no responsibility or liability for any actions or consequences that may result from accessing or using these external sites. Your use of any third-party website or service is at your own risk, and we encourage you to exercise caution and prudence in such situations.
