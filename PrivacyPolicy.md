Information Collection and Use

For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to Contacts, Call Log, Accounts.

I have used ROOM database for database management, so all your data is saved on your phone and never leaves your device to my own servers. No sort of data is collected by me in any way. 

The app does use third-party services from Google Play Services


Service Providers

I have employed third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

To facilitate the process of Google sign-in
To read and write contacts from your Google Account 
To backup and restore database file to Google Drive

I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to their Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

Security

I value your trust in giving your personal data to the app. I fully assure that no data leaves from your device to our own servers. All the data is stored on your phone.
You may choose to backup your database file to your Google Drive. This is the only possible way that your data leaves your phone and is sent to cloud

Links to Other Sites

This Service comtains links to other sites (WhatsApp). This link is used to open the WhatsApp page of that user. 
If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
